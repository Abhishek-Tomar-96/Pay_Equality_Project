# Pay_Equality_Project

## Description

Pay_Equality is a EDA project that focuses on analyzing and addressing the gender pay gap in different countries. The project aims to gain insights into how education, country of residence, and race impact salary disparities between genders. Additionally, the study delves into the identification of the highest paying jobs and the dominant gender occupying these roles.

## Objective

The primary objective of Pay_Equality is to shed light on the existing gender pay gap in various countries, providing valuable information for policymakers, organizations, and individuals striving for a more equitable workforce.

## Key Findings

1. **Average Salary Parity:** Based on the available data, we observe that average salaries show minimal variation across races in each country, emphasizing the importance of investigating other factors affecting the pay gap.

2. **Other Gender's Average Salary Discrepancy:** In specific regions like Canada and the UK, the average salary of the "Other Gender" category appears significantly higher than countries where the male population dominates higher earning positions.

3. **Top Highest Paying Jobs:** Our research identifies the top highest paying jobs, including CEO, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Data Officer, Director of Data Science, and VP of Finance. Moreover, an analysis of these positions highlights the gender disparity in these roles, with males predominantly occupying them.

4. **Female Earnings and Education:** Despite similar education levels, females earn less than their male counterparts, indicating the presence of gender-based salary discrepancies.

5. **Scatter Plot Analysis:** While the relationship between higher education and salaries is inconclusive, we find that experience has a positive correlation with higher earning potential.

6. **Gender Representation in Salary Ranges:** Our analysis reveals that both males and females are relatively similar in counts across different salary ranges, indicating potential equal representation in certain pay brackets.
